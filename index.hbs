title: We Used to Write
---

We used to write, to publish on websites that became blogs and moderated forums that descended
from usenet groups.  I was part of an early wave of eternal September, but the coiners of that
term were absolutely right--September is eternal, and the people its waves wash onto the internet's
shore are just as bewildered now as they always have been, but the continents of Facebook and
Twitter and LinkedIn have made the islands of individuals publishing on little islands feel more
isolated and distant than they were before the continents emerged.
